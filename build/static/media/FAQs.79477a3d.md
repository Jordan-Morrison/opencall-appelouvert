## Frequently Asked Questions FR


**Is there a cost to using Open Call?**

  

There is no fee to use the solutions in Open Call or to seek our help to implement a solution. Even if what you need is not part of the collection, we can advise you and help you build the solution you need.

  

**Who is Open Call for?**

  

-   All levels of government
    
-   Civil servants working on COVID-19 projects who want to create products fast
    
-   Civil servants who are aware of other teams who want to launch a service quickly
    
-   People with zero coding experience, analysts, communications practitioners, developers, and decision makers
    

  

**I’m not a coder, what do I do?**

  

Open Call offers turnkey solutions to get products out the door fast. We provide technical assistance and support to bring services and tools to life. Fill out our [support request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWbl_vdlE1_eIVuZk3mgG46ulp90o-m0kN8YgqjvDuc59GIw/viewform) to describe the solution from the list that reflects your needs and we’ll help you make it happen!

  

**What if the service I need is not reflected in any of the listings?**

  

If your desired solution is not in the resource list, we can consult with you on how to make it happen. Fill out our [support request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWbl_vdlE1_eIVuZk3mgG46ulp90o-m0kN8YgqjvDuc59GIw/viewform) and we’ll reach out within two business days to talk to you about how we can help.

  

**What is open source?**

  

Open source refers to software code that’s available for others to view, copy, and modify. It’s code that’s published under an open source license and typically shared on a software collaboration platform like GitHub.Open source saves time and money, by making software easier to reuse and adapt. And by taking advantage of the tools available in the catalogue and adapting them, you’re making it easier for others to do the same.

  

**What kind of help can I get?**

  

Our pro bono tech support is being offered by Code for Canada, a national nonprofit with a network of civic tech developers and designers across the country, including over 40 fellows with direct experience working in digital government.

In addition to helping you scope a solution, we can offer custom coaching sessions, training workshops to help your team get the skills they need to set up a given tool, and even hands-on development or design sprints to get you up and running.

  

**How are the tools in the collection chosen?**

In the spirit of leveraging open source, we have adopted a similar vetting process as used by the New America Pandemic Response Repository. We recognize that when we list projects on this repository, we are giving them a broader platform and reach and are encouraging governments to reuse this work.

We have developed a simple set of criteria for vetting projects prior to listing them on our repository. Projects must be:

-   Built, run, or maintained by or on behalf of, or for government.
    
-   Open source and available to the public.
    
-   Currently in use to assist in the response efforts against the coronavirus.
    

The open source projects catalogued in the Open Call Repository are powering more efficient and effective public sector responses to the coronavirus pandemic. While we have done some vetting of projects on this repository, we have not performed any kind of deep code or product review. We strongly encourage all governments to conduct due diligence and ensure that the technologies are deployed in an accountable and transparent manner. Although the coronavirus demands a quick response, it must not be at the expense of the rights or security of residents.

**I know of a service or tool that fits the Open Call mould, how do I add it?**

If you would like to suggest a new project be added to the collection or if you have general questions about the project, send us an email at  [appelouvert-opencall@cds-snc.ca](https://opencall-appelouvert.alpha.canada.ca/appelouvert-opencall@cds-snc.ca). If you're in government and would like assistance in setting up or adapting any of the tools in Open Call, fill out our 2-minute [support request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWbl_vdlE1_eIVuZk3mgG46ulp90o-m0kN8YgqjvDuc59GIw/viewform) and we'll be in touch about how we can support you.

  

**Isn’t it faster for us to build our own tool?**

  

Building custom code solutions takes time. You may or may not have a developer on your team and you’re likely working under tight timelines; think of open source as a solution accelerator. When you use it, you’re three steps ahead of where you would be if you started from scratch. It’s for reasons like this -- and many others -- that the Government of Canada and other governments worldwide tout the benefits of [open source](https://digital.canada.ca/2020/02/24/why-open-source-matters/) and [open government](https://open.canada.ca/en).
