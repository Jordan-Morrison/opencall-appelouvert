## About Open Call

## An open source catalogue to help governments respond to COVID-19
Managers, product owners and analysts at all levels of government need reliable self-assessment tools, clear data visualizations, or contact tracing capabilities during a time like this, but we need not start from scratch.

## Open Call is responsive to need
Through informal consultation, we’ve learned that teams across government are working on the same types of projects to inform the public as well as themselves, to enable informed decision-making.

## Open Call is built by developers and vetted by government
Stand on the shoulders of developers who have already made these tools and are sharing the code so your jurisdiction can offer the same service, faster.

## What you can do with Open Call
* Release a contact tracing app
* Create data visualizations to show cases, testing rates and case locations
* Help your constituents take a self-assessment for symptoms of COVID-19
* Launch a chatbot to answer common COVID-19 questions
* Recruit volunteers with digital or IT skills to help address COVID-19-related issues

## Why Open Source?
Open source is software code made available for others to view, copy, and modify. Using open source provides transparency on our work, makes collaborating easier, and generates software that’s easier to reuse and tailor to different government initiatives.
