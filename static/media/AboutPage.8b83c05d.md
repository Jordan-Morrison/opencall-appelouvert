## About Open Call

## Building reusable tools for communities, together
Managers, product owners and analysts at all levels of government need reliable self-assessment tools, clear data visualizations, or contact tracing capabilities during COVID-19, but we need not start from scratch. Open Call can help you get services and information to constituents faster.

Open Call's catalogue includes free, open source tools being used by governments in Canada - and worldwide - to respond to COVID-19. No external procurement is needed to activate the service, meaning it’s free for the Canadian public service, regardless of jurisdiction.

## Free and efficient service delivery
Governments across Canada are working on the same problems: how to keep people informed about recovery efforts, track cases, provide live stats and empower residents to self-assess symptoms or understand benefit eligibility. Open Call curates successful solutions to these challenges, and makes them freely available to government teams. 

## Trusted services already being used by other governments
Our vetting process ensures our collection only features live products actively in use by other jurisdictions.
